- `git clone`: does a one time download from git hub to your local computer
  - make sure the directory that you are cloning into is not already a github repo
- `git status`: tells you everything you need to know about your git hub repo.
- `git add`: adds your specific file to the staging area before commiting.
- `git commit`: saves your changes as a new commit on your local computer with a message of what was changed.
