- `git clone`: does a one time download from git hub to your local computer
  - make sure the directory that you are cloning into is not already a github repo
- `git status`: tells you everything you need to know about your current git hub repo.
- `git add`: adds <FILE> to the staging area.
- `git commit`: creates a commit (aka snapshot) with the changes in the staging area, with the message you supplied.
